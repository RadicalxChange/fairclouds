// webbook for successful checkout

// use the stripe id to check if its a new user.
// if it is a new user then we create a user in directus + send a password reset email to both confirm the email of the user and allow them to set their password.
// if it is an existing user then we just create a subscription in directus.

// how does the frontend know what is happening? does it say you will be sent a confirmation email with purchase details?
